# 🧠 Hypothesis Validation in Tourism Studies using Machine Learning & MLP

This project applies machine learning models and neural networks to validate hypotheses related to tourist satisfaction, destination image, and loyalty — key factors in tourism research.

## 📂 Files Included

- `tourism_hypotheses_ml.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook implementing Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, and MLP  
  
## 🎯 Objective

To evaluate the influence of perceived value and destination image on tourist satisfaction and loyalty using classification models:
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

## 🛠 Techniques Used

- Classification Models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM)
- Deep Learning (MLP)
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Cross-validation
- Hypothesis-driven evaluation

## 📁 Dataset

> ⚠️ **The dataset used in this project is confidential and cannot be shared publicly as per university research guidelines.**

To replicate this project, use any behavioral or tourism dataset that includes features such as:
- Destination image
- Perceived value
- Tourist satisfaction
- Loyalty indicators

## 🔬 Hypotheses Tested

- H1: A positive destination image enhances tourist satisfaction.  
- H2: Perceived value positively influences tourist satisfaction.  
- H3: Tourist satisfaction mediates the link between perceived value and destination image.  
- H4: Destination image positively influences loyalty.  
- H5: Perceived value impacts destination loyalty.  
- H6: Tourist satisfaction impacts loyalty.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- SVM showed the strongest performance among models  
- All models struggled with class imbalance  
- MLP showed potential but requires tuning for better accuracy

## 🚀 Future Work

- Apply ensemble methods (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest)  
- Address class imbalance using resampling or class weights  
- Explore deep learning architectures beyond MLP  
- Perform error analysis on misclassified cases
